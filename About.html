         <h2>About me</h2>
         <p>
  I'm Tensura, a student from Nepal currently studying in Class 11 with a science background. I'm deeply curious about how things work — especially in coding, personal development, and systems thinking. I’m not perfect, but I’ve made a commitment to get better every day. Right now, I’m learning HTML and building structured habits in areas like health, growth, and productivity. I believe progress isn't about speed — it’s about not stopping.
